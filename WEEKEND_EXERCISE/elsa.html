        Elsa the Snow Queen is one of the protagonists of the Frozen franchise. Born with the power of ice and snow, 
        Elsa is the firstborn daughter of King Agnarr and Queen Iduna, the older sister of Queen Anna, and the former 
        queen of Arendelle. Throughout most of her young life, Elsa feared that her powers were monstrous. 
        Therefore, she isolated herself from the world as a means of protecting her family and kingdom. 
        Elsa's anxieties would eventually trigger a curse that plunged Arendelle into an eternal winter. 
        Through Anna's love, however, Elsa was able to control her powers and live peacefully amongst her people 
        with a newfound self-confidence.
