        Sidney, known more commonly as Sid, is a ground sloth who became part of a herd of different animals after 
        a number of adventures and experiences brought them all together.

    <p>
        Born into a family of sloths that went on to abandon him well into his adulthood, Sid met a mammoth 
        named Manny and a saber-tooth tiger named <a href="diego.html">Diego</a> as the three of them made a journey through a tundra 
        to return a human baby named Roshan to his tribe. Following the journey, the three animals remained 
        the best of friends, forming their own "Herd".
