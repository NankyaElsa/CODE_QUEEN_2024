        Diego is a saber-toothed tiger that is part of a herd of animals after living out a number of experiences
        that united them all. Initially a cunning and remorseless hunter in a pack of other sabers,
        Diego was once tasked to deliver a human baby to his pack leader, Soto, as revenge upon the humans.
